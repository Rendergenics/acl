Optional containers and utilities.

## Motivation

The library consists of many allocator implementation, containers and algorithms, which can be used as a building block
for complex data structures. I primarily use these in my other projects to not rely certain external libraries like *boost* 
(because it takes a lot of time to configure and build boost).

Classes are not documented yet, and the focus is on improving code quality for now.


## Building

Use cmake to configure and build. CMakePresets are already present to build on windows and linux.

## Testing

The basic test suite is built by the target `acl-validity`.
On linux coverage data is generated by default.
